 * 	- PPx: Pins Pack 1 to 3, for 3 possible channel outputs on timer.
 *
 * Notes on table above:
 * 	- Not all timers are available on all STM32F4xx devices
 * 	- All timers have 16-bit prescaler
 * 	- TIM6 and TIM7 don't have PWM feature, they are only basic timers
 * 	- TIM2 and TIM5 are 32bit timers
 * 	- TIM9 and TIM12 have two PWM channels
 * 	- TIM10, TIM11, TIM13 and TIM14 have only one PWM channel
 * 	- All channels at one timer have the same PWM frequency!
