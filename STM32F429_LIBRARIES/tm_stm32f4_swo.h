 * @brief    SWO Debugging library for Cortex-M4/M3 processors including STM32F4xx - http://stm32f4-discovery.com/2014/12/library-46-debug-stm32f4-device-swo-feature/
 * @{
 *
 * Instead of using UART for debugging your program, you can use better solution for this.
 *
 * STM32F4xx (all Cortex-M4 MCUs) have SWD programming/debugging mode. 
 *
 * It also contains SWO (Single Wire Output) for debugging purpose.
 *
 * This output works only (!!) when you are in debug mode with your processor.
 * 
 * This library allows you to send data to PC using SWO peripheral.
 * 
 * Library is designed in a way that you can with simple define disable debug functionality,
 * but you don't need to clear all your debug statements somewhere in your code.
 *
 * By default, debug mode is active, but if you want to disable it, you can open defines.h file and add following define inside:
 *
@verbatim
//Disable debug mode, disable all functions
#define SWO_DEBUG_ENABLED     0
@endverbatim
 *
 * Note, that if you don't disable SWO debugging in end application, it will work,
 * but will take some processor cycles to try to output data. To prevent this checking,
 * using define above, my functions becomes empty defines and compiler will throw them out from program.
 *
 * Important notes:
 *	- Your IDE must include debugging functionality,
 *		- If it does not, you can download "STM32 ST-LINK Utility" from st.com and connect via ST-Link to your device,
 *		- In opened program click on "ST-LINK" -> "Printf via SWO viewer",
 *		- Set CPU frequency and hit "Start"
 *	- Keil uVIsion have debug option built-in,
 *		- In "Options for target" go to "Debug" tab, select your debugger and hit "Settings" (ST-Link for most cases)
 *		- Under "Trace" tab set CPU frequency under "Core Clock" and click on "Enable Trace"
 * 		- Under "ITM Stimulus Part" write "0x00000001" where you have "Enable" window,
 *		- You have 4 checkboxes for "Ports":
 *			- Enable "Port 31..24"
 *			- Disable other 3
 *		- Compile your application and click on "Start/Stop Debug Session"
 *		- On the left top, find button "Run" or press "F5" and if you don't have it, open Trace window under 
 *		  "View" tab
 *	- In case you are using STM32F4xx boards, you might made some modifications to enable "Trace output":
 *		- STM32F4-Discovery: Enabled by default
 *		- STM32F429-Discovery: You have to solder SB9 jumper to enable this feature
 *		- STM32-Nucleo: Enabled by default
 *			- Nucleo boards have different ST-Link firmware and I've never got this working with my Nucleo F401 or F411,
 *			  I always get error "Cannot read memory" in Keil uVision, also ST-Link Utility does not work.
 *			- With external debugger connected to SWD pins, works great. It must be problem with ST-Link on Nucleo boards.
 * - Pin PB3 is output for SWO in STM32F4xx.
