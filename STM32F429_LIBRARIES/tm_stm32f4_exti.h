 * @brief    External interrupts library for STM32F4 devices - http://stm32f4-discovery.com/2014/10/library-38-external-interrupts-for-stm32f4
 * @{
 *
 * This library allows you to easy enable external interrupt on specific pin.
 * 
 * You only need to specify GPIOx, pin and interrupt trigger you want to use and you are ready to use.
 * There are predefined function names that you use to handle this interrupts.
 * 
 * There are 16 external interrupts possible, GPIO lines 0 to 15.
 * Each GPIO_PIN_x from all GPIOx is connected to one line. In other words, PC0, PA0, PB0, PJ0,...
 * are all connected to line 0, and so on. But you can use only one pin for one line at a time.
 * So only PA0 at one time, or PD0 or PC0, but one a time.
 * 
 * You can still use more lines at the same time. So let's say PA0 is line0 and PC13 is line13.
 * This 2 interrupts can be used simultaneouly without problems.
 *
 * \par Handling interrupts
 *
 * Next step is handling interrupts.
 * There are 16 interrupt lines, but only 7 interrupt handlers.
 * Lines0 to 4 have each own handler, then lines 5 to 9 have one common
 * and lines 10 to 15 have one common.
 * 
 * I write these functions in my library and use my own to handle specific line for you for easly.
 * Sometimes there is need for use default handler names in your own, but 2 functions with same name 
 * can not be used, so I made some settings.
 * 
 * If you open defines.h file and add any of lines below, you will disable handler line for interrupts.
 * By default, all handlers for lines are enabled. Disabled then with adding lines below in defines.h file:
 * 
@verbatim
//Disable EXTI0_IRQHandler function
#define TM_EXTI_DISABLE_DEFAULT_HANDLER_0
//Disable EXTI1_IRQHandler function
#define TM_EXTI_DISABLE_DEFAULT_HANDLER_1
//Disable EXTI2_IRQHandler function
#define TM_EXTI_DISABLE_DEFAULT_HANDLER_2
//Disable EXTI3_IRQHandler function
#define TM_EXTI_DISABLE_DEFAULT_HANDLER_3
//Disable EXTI4_IRQHandler function
#define TM_EXTI_DISABLE_DEFAULT_HANDLER_4
//Disable EXTI9_5_IRQHandler function
#define TM_EXTI_DISABLE_DEFAULT_HANDLER_9_5
//Disable EXTI15_10_IRQHandler function
#define TM_EXTI_DISABLE_DEFAULT_HANDLER_15_10
@endverbatim
 * 
 * If you need higher priority for external interrupts in NVIC, add lines below in defines.h file and edit them
@verbatim
//Set custom NVIC priority
#define TM_EXTI_NVIC_PRIORITY	0x0A
@endverbatim
 *
 * \par Changelog
 *
@verbatim
 Version 1.4
  - June 22, 2015
  - Added support for clearing all external interrupt with DeInit function
  
 Version 1.3
  - March 23 2015 - Totally independent from HAL / SPD drivers
  - Library can be used with any drivers or totally itself
  - Now only one function handler TM_EXTI_Handler for all lines. No separate handlers anymore.
  
 Version 1.2
  - March 10, 2015
  - TM GPIO Library supported

 Version 1.1
  - March 08, 2015
  - Added function TM_EXTI_Handler, which is called anytime EXTI interrupt occur,
       no matter on which GPIO_Pin. GPIO_Pin_x is passed as argument where x is 0 to 15

 Version 1.0
  - First release
