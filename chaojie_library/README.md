This is a place where I put library I wrote. The library will be in ```inc``` folder and ```src``` folder, and they will start with cj_. These folders have other source code. This is for main.c to compile so we can test the code I wrote.

### cj_state.h
code for doing state estimation. 

### cj_helper.h
important helper functions. 

### TODO
implement Kalman filter for state estimation
