###Drone project

##Folder description
1. Device_drivers: drivers for sensors and other devices.
2. original_library: libraries we got from the internet. (usually device drivers, but needed to be fixed for NUCLEO, our development borad)
3. test_transceiver: projects to acquire data wirelessly. There are two projects, receiver and transmitter projects.
4. tracking_with_MPU9150: tracking the position of the sensor. If this works, we will have a fix coordinate to represent all relevent quantities, like forces, accelerations, angles and so on. 
5. eclipse settings: contains default eclipse settings
