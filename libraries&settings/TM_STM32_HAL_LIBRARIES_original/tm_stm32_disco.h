 * \par Select your board
 *
 * To select your board, you have several options:
 *   - Add define for your board in defines.h file or
 *   - Add define for your board in compiler's global settings
 *     - For Keil uVision you have "Options for Target" and "C/C++" tab where you can set this.
 *
 * Imagine, we want to work with STM324x9-Eval board. Then, you can open <code>defines.h</code> file and add define:
 *
@verbatim
//Select STM32F439-Eval for DISCO library
#define STM32F439_EVAL
@endverbatim
 * Or if you want STM32F429-Discovery, do this:
@verbatim
//Select STM32F429-Discovery for DISCO library
#define STM32F429_DISCOVERY
@endverbatim
 *
