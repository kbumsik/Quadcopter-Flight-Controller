 * @{
 *
 * \par Pinout
 *
 * Library supports 2 modes of connecting and use:
 *  - MII: Media Independent Interface
 *  - RMII: Reduced Media Independent Interface
 *
 * \par MII Connection
 *
 * MII connection uses a lot of pins, but has slower (25MHz) reference clock.
 *
 * It uses 4 data bytes and with 25MHz clock, you get 100Mbit connection.
 *
 * To enable MII connection mode, open defines.h file and add define like below:
 *
@verbatim
//Enable MII connection mode
#define ETHERNET_MII_MODE
@endverbatim
 *
 *

 *
 * \par RMII Connection
 *
 * RMII connection uses a small number of pins, but has greater (50MHz) reference clock.
 *
 * It uses 2 data bytes and with 50MHz clock, you get 100Mbit connection.
 *
 * RMII mode is supported using 2 pinspacks. By default, PP1 (PinsPack 1) is used. If you want to use PP2, then you need define in defines.h file:
 *
@verbatim
//Enable PinsPack 2 for RMII ethernet:
#define ETHERNET_RMII_PINSPACK_2
@endverbatim
 *
@verbatim
ETH PHY     |STM32F4xx with ethernet
            |PP1    |PP2

TXD0        |PB12   |PG13
TXD1        |PB13   |PG14
@endverbatim
 *
 * Also, PA8 pins HAVE TO be initialized as MCO alternate function, or communication will not work. Who knows why.
 *
 * PA8 pin is also MCO output, which has ability to output different clocks.
 *
 * I've added feature to output HSE crystal on this MCO pin. It can be used for 25MHz output if you have HSE 25MHz crystal and MII connection.
 *
 * Then you don't need separate crystal for PHY device.
 *
 * To enable MCO output HSE crystal value, open defines.h file and add define:
 *
@verbatim
//Enable MCO output with HSE clock
#define ETHERNET_MCO_CLOCK
@endverbatim
 *
 * \par DHCP
 *
 * Library supports DHCP to get IP from router.
 * This feature is disabled by default
 * To enable it, you need to add define in defines.h file:
 *
@verbatim
//Enable DHCP 
#define ETHERNET_USE_DHCP
@endverbatim
 *
 *\par Supported PHY devices
 *
 * This library supports more than just DP83848 PHY. Currently, supported list is below.
 * The number which is near text means value you have to set @ref ETHERNET_PHY define in case you want to select custom PHY.
 *
 *	- 0: DP83848
 *	- 1: LAN8720A
 *	- 2: KSZ8081RNA
 *
 * If you want (for example) to use KSZ8081RNA PHY, you need to do this (defines.h):
 *
@verbatim
//Use KSZ8081RNA PHY
#define ETHERNET_PHY   2
@endverbatim
 *
