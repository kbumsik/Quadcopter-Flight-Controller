 *
 * This library allows you to change PLL settings on the FLY.
 * 
 * It can be used to dynamically change system clock for various reasons.
 *
 * @note After you change PLL settings, some peripherals (like USART, Systick, TIMERS) will no longer work properly.
 *       Doing a reinit would fix that!
