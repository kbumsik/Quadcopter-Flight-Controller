 * @brief    Low power library for STM32F4xx devices - http://stm32f4-discovery.com/2014/10/library-39-power-consumption-modes-for-stm32f4
 * @{
 *
 * This library can put MCU into 3 different modes:
 *
 * \par SLEEP mode
 *
 * - Cortex-M4 core is stopped
 * - Peripherals kept running
 * - How to enter this mode?
 *    - Use TM_LOWPOWER_SleepUntilInterrupt() or
 *    - Use TM_LOWPOWER_SleepUntilEvent();
 * - How to exit this mode?
 *    - Any peripheral interrupt acknowledged by the nested vectored interrupt controller (NVIC)
 *
 * \par STOP mode
 *
 * - All clocks in 1.2V domain are stopped
 * - PLL, HSI and HSE RC oscillators disabled
 * - Internal SRAM and register contents are preserved
 * - Voltage regulator in low-power mode
 * - How to enter this mode?
 *    - Use TM_LOWPOWER_StopUntilEvent() or
 *    - Use TM_LOWPOWER_StopUntilInterrupt()
 * - How to exit this mode?
 *    - Any EXTI Line (Internal or External) configured in Interrupt/Event mode
 *
 * \par STANDBY mode
 *
 * - Cortex-M4 deepsleep mode
 * - Voltage regulator disabled
 * - 1.2V domain consequently powered off
 * - PLL, HSI and HSE RC oscillators disabled
 * - SRAM and register contents are lost except for the RTC registers, RTC backup registers, backup SRAM and Standby circuitry
 * - How to enter this mode?
 *    - Use TM_LOWPOWER_Standby() function
 * - How to exit this mode?
 *    - Wakeup pin rising edge
 *    - RTC alarm (Alarm A and B) and wakeup
 *    - tamper and time-stamp event
 *    - external reset in NRST pin
 *    - IWDG reset
 * 
 * \par Changelog
 *
@verbatim
 Version 1.2
  - March 23, 2015
  - Fixed problems with entering to standby mode
  
 Version 1.1
  - October 18, 2014
  - Added TM_LOWPOWER_StandbyReset(). This allows you to check if system was reset from standby wakeup

 Version 1.0
  - First release
