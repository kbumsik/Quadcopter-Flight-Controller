@par Directory contents
 
 - Project.uvprojx/.uvoptx: A pre-configured project file with the provided library 
                          structure that produces an executable image with MDK-ARM.

 @note Enabling "Options for Target — Output – Browser Information" is useful for
       quick source files navigation but may slow the compilation time.                 
 
 
@par How to use it ?
 
 - Open the Project.uvprojx project
 - In the workspace toolbar select the project config:
     - STM32F429_439xx: to configure the project for STM32F429xx/439xx devices.
     @note The needed define symbols for this config are already declared in the
           preprocessor section: USE_STM324x9I_EVAL, STM32F429_439xx, USE_STDPERIPH_DRIVER

    - STM32F427_437xx: to configure the project for STM32F427xx/437xx devices.
     @note The needed define symbols for this config are already declared in the
           preprocessor section: USE_STM324x7I_EVAL, STM32F427_437xx, USE_STDPERIPH_DRIVER
           
     - STM32F40_41xxx: to configure the project for STM32F40/41xxx devices.
     @note The needed define symbols for this config are already declared in the
           preprocessor section: USE_STM324xG_EVAL, STM32F40_41xxx, USE_STDPERIPH_DRIVER
           
     - STM32F401xx: to configure the project for STM32F401xx devices.
     @note The needed define symbols for this config are already declared in the
           preprocessor section: STM32F401xx, USE_STDPERIPH_DRIVER
		   
	 - STM32F446xx: to configure the project for STM32F446xx devices.
     @note The needed define symbols for this config are already declared in the
           preprocessor section: STM32F446xx, USE_STDPERIPH_DRIVER
