@par Application Description 

This application guides STM32Cube HAL API users to run a http server application 
based on Netconn API of LwIP TCP/IP stack
The communication is done with a web browser application in a remote PC.

this HTTP server contains two html pages:
  + the first page (home page) is static, it gives information about STM32F4
    and LwIP stack.
  + the second page is dynamically refreshed (every 1 s), it shows the RTOS 
    statistics in runtime

If the LCD is used (#define USE_LCD in main.h), log messages will be displayed 
to inform user about ethernet cable status and the IP address value, else this 
will be ensured by LEDs:
  + LED1: ethernet cable is connected.
  + LED2: ethernet cable is not connected.

If a DHCP server is available, a dynamic IP address can be allocated by enabling 
the DHCP process (#define USE_DHCP in main.h)

Note: In this application the Ethernet Link ISR need the System tick interrupt 
to configure the Ethernet MAC, so the Ethernet Link interrupt priority must be 
set lower (numerically greater) than the Systick interrupt priority to ensure 
that the System tick increments while executing the Ethernet Link ISR.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32F407xx/STM32F417xx Devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with the following environments:
     - STM324xG-EVAL board
     - Http clients: Firefox Mozilla (v24) or Microsoft Internet Explorer (v8 and later)
     - DHCP server:  PC utility TFTPD32 (http://tftpd32.jounin.net/) is used as a DHCP server    
      
  - STM324xG-EVAL RevC Set-up
    - Connect the eval board to remote PC (through a crossover ethernet cable)
      or to your local network (through a straight ethernet cable)
  
  - Remote PC Set-up
    - Configure a static IP address for your remote PC 
      for example 192.168.0.11
