@par Application Description

This application provides a description on how to use STM32Cube firmware with FatFs 
middleware component as a generic FAT file system module, FreeRTOS as an RTOS
module based on using CMSIS-OS wrapping layer common APIs, and also STM32 USB 
On-The-Go (OTG) host library, in both Full Speed (FS) and High Speed (HS) modes,
in order to develop an application exploiting FatFs offered features with USB 
disk drive in RTOS mode configuration.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock
(SYSCLK) to run at 168 MHz.
           
The application is based on writing two text files to a drive. Two threads, with
different priorities, are created to manage multiple access to the FAT volumes
through FatFs APIs as described in the following steps:  

 - StartThread with a normal priority executing steps below:           
   - Link the USB Host disk I/O driver;
   - Register the file system object (mount) to the FatFs module for the USB drive;
   - Create and Open new text file object with write access;
   - Write data to the text file;
   - Close the open text file.
 
 - ConcurrentThread with a high priority executing steps below:  
   - Create and Open new text file object with write access;
   - Write data to the text file;
   - Close the open text file;
   - Unlink the USB Host disk I/O driver.
 
It is worth noting that the application manages any error occurred during the 
access to FAT volume, when using FatFs APIs. Otherwise, user can check if the
written text files are available on the USB disk.

It is possible to fine tune needed FatFs features by modifying defines values 
in FatFs configuration file “ffconf.h” available under the project includes 
directory, in a way to fit the application requirements. 

STM32 Eval board's LEDs can be used to monitor the application status:
  - LED1 and LED4 are ON when the application runs successfully.
  - LED3 is ON when any error occurs.


@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

on STM32Cube with FatFs".

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32F407xx/417xx devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL RevC 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board. 

  - STM324xG-EVAL RevC Set-up
    - Plug the USB key into the STM324xG-EVAL board through 'USB micro A-Male 
      to A-Female' cable to the connector:
      - CN9: to use USB High Speed (HS) 
      - CN8: to use USB Full Speed (FS) with embedded PHY(U2)


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - In the workspace toolbar select the project configuration:
   - STM324xG-EVAL_USBH-HS: to configure the project for STM32F4xx devices using USB OTG HS peripheral
   - STM324xG-EVAL_USBH-FS: to configure the project for STM32F4xx devices using USB OTG FS peripheral
 - Run the application
