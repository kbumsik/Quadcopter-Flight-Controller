@par Application Description 

This application guides STM32Cube HAL API users to run an SSL client application 
based on PolarSSL crypto library and LwIP TCP/IP stack

To off-load the CPU from encryption/decryption, hash and RNG, all these 
algorithms are implemented using the hardware acceleration AES 128/192/256, 
Triple DES, MD5, SHA-1 and analog RNG through the STM32Cube HAL APIs 

In this application the client (STM3241G-EVAL) sends a crypted message to the 
server (test PC), which will decrypt the message then reply to the client.

The HyperTerminal can be used to debug messages exchanged between client and 
server.

Note: In this application the Ethernet Link ISR need the System tick interrupt 
to configure the Ethernet MAC, so the Ethernet Link interrupt priority must be 
set lower (numerically greater) than the Systick interrupt priority to ensure 
that the System tick increments while executing the Ethernet Link ISR.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

For more details about this application, refer to UM1723 "STM32Cube PolarSSL application".

@par Hardware and Software environment  

  - This application runs on STM32F417xx Devices.
  
  - This application has been tested with the following environments: 
     - STM3241G-EVAL board RevB
     - ssl_server.exe: PC utility is used as SSL server application
        This utility is provided within STM32CubeF4 package under "/Utilities/PC_Software/ssl_server"
     - DHCP server: PC utility TFTPD32 (http://tftpd32.jounin.net/) is used as a DHCP server 
     - HyperTerminal: used to display debug messages
  
  - STM3241G-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect STM3241G-EVAL board to remote PC (through a crossover ethernet cable)
      or to your local network (through a straight ethernet cable)
    - RS232 link (used with HyperTerminal like application to display debug messages):
      connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
      CN16 (USART3) and PC serial port.

  - Remote PC Set-up
    - Configure a static IP address for your remote PC 
      this address must be as defined in ssl_client.c: 192.168.0.1 by default 


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the application

 @Note: 1 Please ensure that the remote PC IP address is the same IP address 
          as the one defined in ssl_client.c file
          (#define SSL_SERVER_NAME "192.168.0.1").
      
        2 If you using a firewall, you must be sure that ssl_server application
          accepts connection requests. Otherwise, the firewall refuses the 
          client requests.
