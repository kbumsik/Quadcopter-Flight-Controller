@par Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to use the CRYPTO peripheral to 
encrypt and decrypt data using AES-128 Algorithm with ECB chaining mode.

For this example, DMA is used to transfer data from memory to the CRYPTO
processor IN FIFO and also to transfer data from CRYPTO processor OUT FIFO
to memory.

The data to be encrypted is a 256-bit data (8 words), which correspond to
2x AES-128 Blocks.

This example behaves as below: 
- AES Encryption (Plain Data --> Encrypted Data)
- AES Key preparation for decryption (Encryption Key --> Decryption Key)
- AES Decryption (Encrypted Data --> Decrypted Data)

STM32 Eval board's LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer status:
 - LED1 is ON when encryption is right.
 - LED2 is ON when encryption is wrong.
 - LED3 is ON when there is an initialization error occurred.

The Plain data, encrypted data and decrypted data can be displayed on a PC 
HyperTerminal using the USART (CN16).

@note To ensure right functionality of this example, please ensure that used 
      buffers are 32-bit aligned, once enabling the DMA capability.
      
@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F417xx devices.  
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32417G-EVAL RevC 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM324xG-EVAL RevC Set-up
    - Please ensure that jumper JP22 is in position RS232.                 
                 
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
