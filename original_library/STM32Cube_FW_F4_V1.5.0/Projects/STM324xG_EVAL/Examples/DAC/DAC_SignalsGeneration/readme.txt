@par Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to use the DAC peripheral to 
generate several signals using DMA controller.
When the user presses the KEY push-button, DMA transfers the two selected 
waveforms to the DAC.
For each press on KEY button, a signal has been selected and can be monitored on  
the DAC channel one:
    - Triangle waveform (Channel 1).
    - Escalator waveform (Channel 1).

STM32 Eval board's LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer status:
  - LED3 is ON when there are an error in initialization.
    
@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F40xxx/STM32F41xxx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM324xG-EVAL evaluation board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM324xG-EVAL RevC Set-up 	
     - Use KEY push-button connected to PC13.
     - Connect PA4 (DAC Channel1) pin to an oscilloscope.
     

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
