@par Example Description 

This example guides you through the different configuration steps by mean of HAL API 
to ensure WWDG counter update at regular period and simulate a software fault 
generating an MCU WWDG reset on expiry of a programmed time period.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
clock (SYSCLK) to run at 168 MHz.

The WWDG peripheral configuration is ensured by the HAL_WWDG_Init() function.
This later is calling the HAL_WWDG_MspInit()function which core is implementing
the configuration of the needed WWDG resources according to the used hardware (CLOCK, 
GPIO, DMA and NVIC). You may update this function to change WWDG configuration.

The WWDG timeout is set to 49.92 ms and the refresh window is set to 80. 
The WWDG counter is refreshed each 40ms in the main program infinite loop to 
prevent a WWDG reset.
LED2 is also toggled each 40 ms indicating that the program is running.

An EXTI Line is connected to a GPIO pin, and configured to generate an interrupt
on the rising edge of the signal.

The EXTI Line is used to simulate a software failure: once the EXTI Line event 
occurs by pressing the Key push-button(PG.15), the corresponding interrupt is served.

In the ISR, a write to invalid address generates a Hardfault exception containing
an infinite loop and preventing to return to main program (the WWDG counter is 
not refreshed).

As a result, when the WWDG counter falls to 63, the WWDG reset occurs.
  
If the WWDG reset is generated, after the system resumes from reset, LED1 turns ON.

If the EXTI Line event does not occur, the WWDG counter is indefinitely refreshed
in the main program infinite loop, and there is no WWDG reset.

LED3 will turn ON, if any error is occurred.


@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment  
  - This example runs on STM32F407xx/417xx devices.    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL RevC 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.


@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
