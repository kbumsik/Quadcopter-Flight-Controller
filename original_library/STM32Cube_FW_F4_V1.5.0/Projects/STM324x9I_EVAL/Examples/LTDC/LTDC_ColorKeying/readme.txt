@par Example Description

 This example describe how to enable and use the color keying functionality.

 At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
 all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
 Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
 clock (SYSCLK) to run at 180 MHz.
 
 After LCD initialization, LCD layer 1 and color keying configuration, an image 
 is displayed on LCD.
 Color keying is enabled/disabled on the image when the tamper button is pressed.
 
 @note : 
 The C file of the image used in this example are generated with 
 STemWin bitmap converter released with this package.
 \Middlewares\ST\STemWin\Software\BmpCvtST.exe
 Use the bitmap file under resources repository
             
 Color Keying :
 --------------
 If the Color Keying is enabled, all pixels are compared to the color key. 
 If they match the programmed RGB value, all channels (ARGB) of that pixel 
 are set to 0.

STM32 Eval board's LED can be used to monitor the transfer status:
 - LED3 is ON when there is an error in Init process.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment  

  - This example runs on STM32F429xx/STM32F439xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324x9I-EVAL RevB 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.


@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
