@par Example Description 

This example guides you through the different configuration steps by mean of HAL API 
to ensure Calendar configuration using the RTC peripheral.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
clock (SYSCLK) to run at 180 MHz.

The RTC peripheral configuration is ensured by the HAL_RTC_Init() function.
This later is calling the HAL_RTC_MspInit()function which core is implementing
the configuration of the needed RTC resources according to the used hardware (CLOCK, 
PWR, RTC clock source and BackUp). You may update this function to change RTC configuration.

LSE oscillator clock is used as RTC clock source. LSE oscillator clock usually 
delivered by a 32.768 kHz quartz.

HAL_RTC_SetTime()and HAL_RTC_SetDate() functions are then called to initialize the 
time and the date.

A key value is written in backup data register 0 to indicate if the RTC is already configured.  
The RTC is in the backup (BKP) domain, still powered by VBAT when VDD is switched off,
so the RTC configuration is not lost if a battery is connected to the VBAT pin. 

The program behaves as follows:

1. After startup the program checks the backup data register 0 value:
    - BKP_DR0 value not correct: (RTC_BKP_DR0 value is not correct or has not yet
      been programmed when the program is executed for the first time) the RTC is
      configured.
    
    - BKP_DR0 value correct: this means that the RTC is configured and the time
      and date are displayed on Debugger.

2. When an External Reset occurs the BKP domain is not reset and the RTC configuration
   is not lost, LED4 is ON.

3. When power on reset occurs:
    - If a battery is connected to the VBAT pin: the BKP domain is not reset and
      the RTC configuration is not lost, LED2 is ON.
      
    - If no battery is connected to the VBAT pin: the BKP domain is reset and the
      RTC configuration is lost.

 @note LED3 turns ON when there is an error in initialization. 
      

The current time and date are updated and displayed on the debugger in aShowTime 
and aShowDate variables.


@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@note  Care must be taken when HAL_RCCEx_PeriphCLKConfig() is used to select the RTC clock source; in this 
       case the Backup domain will be reset in order to modify the RTC Clock source, as consequence RTC  
       registers (including the backup registers) and RCC_BDCR register are set to their reset values.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F42xxx/STM32F43xxx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM324x9I-EVAL RevB evaluation board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.    
      
  - STM324x9I-EVAL RevB Set-up
    - Please ensure that jumper JP8 is in position 2-3 to connect 3V battery to VBAT pin.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
