@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use the CRYPTO peripheral to
encrypt and decrypt data using AES with Galois/Counter Mode (GCM).
The AES-GCM mode requires:
1. Plain text which will be authenticated and encrypted. Its size must be a
   multiple of 16 bytes. So if the original plain text size is not a multiple
   of 16 bytes, it must be padded.
2. Header that will be authenticated but not encrypted. The header size must be
   multiple of 16 bytes whatever the key size.
3. Initialization vector a value that is used only once within a specified
   context. It must be padded to 16-byte length with LSB set to 2. 
4. Key is the parameter which determines the cipher text. In this example the
   key size is 128 bits =16 bytes but it can be tailored to 192 bits or 256 bits.

The AES-GCM provides:
1. Cipher text which is the encryption result of the Plaint text. In this
   example, the cipher text is available in "EncryptedText".
   Its size is the same as the plain text.
2. Plain text which is the decryption result of the Cipher text. In this
   example, the plain text is available in "DecryptedText".
   Its size is the same as the plain text. 
3. TAG: The Message Authentication Code which is used for both message
   authentication and message tampering detection. It's size is always 16 bytes.
   
The Plain data, encrypted data, authentication TAG (MAC) and decrypted data can
be displayed on a PC HyperTerminal using the UART.

The USARTx is configured as follows:
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled

@note To ensure right functionality of this example, please ensure that used 
      buffers are 32-bit aligned, once enabling the DMA capability.
          
@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F439xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32439I-EVAL RevB 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.      

  - STM324x9I-EVAL RevB Set-up
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
      CN8 (USART1) and PC serial port if you want to display data on the HyperTerminal.
      Please ensure that jumper JP7 is in position RS232_RX
     
  - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
