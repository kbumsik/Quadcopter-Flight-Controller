@par Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to use the CRYPTO peripheral to
encrypt data using AES with Combined Cipher Machine (CCM).
The AES-CCM mode requires:
1. Plain text which will be authenticated and encrypted. Its size must be a multiple
   of 16 bytes. So if the original plain text size is not a multiple of 16 bytes
   it must be padded.
2. Header (associated data) that will be authenticated but not encrypted.
   The header if formatted in HBuffer[]: the header size is concatenated with the
   original header.
3. Nonce a value that is used only once within a specified context. Its size must
   be 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 or 13.
4. Key is the parameter which determines the cipher text. In this example the key
   size is 128 bits = 16 bytes but it can be tailored to 192 bits and 256 bits.

The AES-CCM provides:
1. Cipher text which is the encryption result of Plain text. In this example, the
   cipher text is available in OutputText.
   Its size is the same as the plain text.
2. MAC: The Message Authentication Code which is used for both message authentication
   and message tampering detection. It's size is lower or equal to 16 bytes.

STM32 Eval board's LEDs can be used to monitor the encryption status:
 - LED1 is ON when encryption is right.
 - LED2 is ON when encryption is wrong.

@note To ensure right functionality of this example, please ensure that used 
      buffers are 32-bit aligned, once enabling the DMA capability.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F439xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32439I-EVAL RevB 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.    


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
