@par Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to use the CRYPTO peripheral to
encrypt and decrypt data using AES in chaining modes (ECB, CBC, CTR) and all key
sizes (128, 192, 256) Algorithm.

For this example, a firmware is used to interface with the Crypto peripheral
in polling mode.

This program behaves as follows:

1. ECB mode:
   - AES128 ECB Encryption
   - AES192 ECB Encryption
   - AES256 ECB Encryption

   - AES128 ECB Decryption
   - AES192 ECB Decryption
   - AES256 ECB Decryption

2. CBC mode:
   - AES128 CBC Encryption
   - AES192 CBC Encryption
   - AES256 CBC Encryption

   - AES128 CBC Decryption
   - AES192 CBC Decryption
   - AES256 CBC Decryption

3. CTR mode:
   - AES128 CTR Encryption
   - AES192 CTR Encryption
   - AES256 CTR Encryption

   - AES128 CTR Decryption
   - AES192 CTR Decryption
   - AES256 CTR Decryption

 @note The data to decrypt(aCiphertext) is different from the encryption 
       result of  aPlaintext, so the result of decryption will not be the 
       Plain Data. 

The Plain data, encrypted data and decrypted data can be displayed on a PC
Hyperterminal using the UART.

The USARTx is configured as follows:
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled

@note To ensure right functionality of this example, please ensure that used 
      buffers are 32-bit aligned, once enabling the DMA capability.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F439xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32439I-EVAL RevB 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board. 
    
  - STM324x9I-EVAL RevB Set-up
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
      CN8 (USART1) and PC serial port if you want to display data on the HyperTerminal.
      Please ensure that jumper JP7 is in position RS232_RX
     
  - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled     

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
