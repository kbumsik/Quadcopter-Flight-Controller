@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use the different BSP drivers. 

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock
(SYSCLK) to run at 175 MHz and provide 50 MHz at the output PLL divided by PLL_Q. 
This frequency permit to reach 25 MHz clock needed for SD operation and in line 
with microSD specification. 


This example shows how to use the different functionalities of LCD, SD card, 
touchscreen, joystick and external memories (SDRAM, SRAM, NOR) by switching 
between all tests using key button. 

Firstly, use the joystick button to move a pointer inside a rectangle 
(up/down/right/left) and change the pointer color(select).

Secondly, and after the touchscreen calibration, use the touchscreen 
functionality to select or activate colored circle inside a rectangle.

Thirdly, this example shows how to use the different LCD features to display string
with different fonts, to display different shapes and to draw a bitmap.

Fourthly, this example shows how to erase, write and read the SD card and also 
how to detect the presence of the card.

Fifthly, this example shows how to use the LCD log features.

Sixthly, this example provides of how to write, read and buffers compare 
for different external memories (SDRAM, SRAM, NOR).

Seventhly, this example shows how to read and write data in RF EEPROM. The I2C EEPROM
memory (M24LR64) is available on separate daughter board ANT7-M24LR-A, which is not
provided with the STM324x9I-EVAL board. To use this driver you have to connect the 
ANT7-M24LR-A to CN3 connector of STM324x9I-EVAL board.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment  

  - This example runs on STM32F429xx/STM32F439xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324x9I-EVAL RevB 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.
    
  - STM324x9I-EVAL RevB Setup: For NOR memory use, make sure that the Jumper JP9
    is open and JP5 is put in position 1-2 (NWAIT signal connected to PD6).  

  
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
