@par Example Description 

This example presents the MPU features on STM32F4xx devices and it can be easily
ported to any other STM32 device supporting MPU.

The example purpose is to configure a memory region as privileged read only region
and tries to perform read and write operation in different mode.

If the access is permitted LED1 is toggling. If the access is not permitted, 
a memory management fault is generated and LED2 is ON.
To generate an MPU memory fault exception due to an access right error, uncomment
the following line "PrivilegedReadOnlyArray[0] = 'e';" in the "stm32_mpu.c" file.


@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F42xxx/STM32F43xxx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM324x9I-EVAL RevB evaluation board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board. 


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Add the required example files
   - stm32_mpu.c
 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
