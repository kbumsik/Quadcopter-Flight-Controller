@par Example Description

  This example provides a description of how to configure DMA2D peripheral in 
  Register_to_Memory transfer mode and display the result on LCD.

  At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
  all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
  Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
  clock (SYSCLK) to run at 180 MHz.
 
  The Register_to_Memory transfer mode, is used to fill a user defined area by a 
  fixed color.
 
  After DMA2D configuration, the data transfer is performed and then the LCD is 
  configured to display color zone created after this transfer on LCD. 
  (more details about LCD configuration in LCD examples)

  @note 
  => Output offset is the number of pixel to be skipped after each transferred line
                      
  how to calculate the size of the transferred data ? 
  => selected color mode gives the number of bits per pixel and we have 
     (ARGB4444 => 16bits/pixel) the number of pixel per line and the number of line, 
     therefore :
    
     data_size = (bits per pixel) X (pixel per line + output offset) X (number of line) 
       
STM32 Eval board's LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer status:
 - LED1 is ON when the transfer is complete.
 - LED2 is ON when there is a transfer error.
 - LED3 is ON when there is an error in transfer/Init process.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment  

  - This example runs on STM32F429xx/STM32F439xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324x9I-EVAL RevB 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.
                

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
