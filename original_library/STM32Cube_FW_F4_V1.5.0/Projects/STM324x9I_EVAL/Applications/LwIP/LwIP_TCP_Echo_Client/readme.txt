@par Application Description 

This application guides STM32Cube HAL API users to run TCP Echo Client application 
based on Raw API of LwIP TCP/IP stack

To run this application, On the remote PC, open a command prompt window.
(In Windows, select Start > All Programs > Accessories > Command Prompt.)
At the command prompt, enter:
    C:\>echotool /p tcp /s
where:
    – /p transport layer protocol used for communication (TCP)
    – /s is the actual mode of connection (Server mode)
    
Each time the user pushes the KEY button of the STM324x9I-EVAL board, an echo 
request is sent to the server

STM32 Eval board LEDs are used for the following purpose:
  + LED1: ethernet cable is connected.
  + LED2: ethernet cable is not connected.

Note: In this application the Ethernet Link ISR need the System tick interrupt 
to configure the Ethernet MAC, so the Ethernet Link interrupt priority must be 
set lower (numerically greater) than the Systick interrupt priority to ensure 
that the System tick increments while executing the Ethernet Link ISR.

Note: By default, the Ethernet Half duplex mode is not supported in the 
STM324x9I-EVAL board, for more information refer to the HAL_ETH_MspInit() 
function in the ethernetif.c file

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.
      
For more details about this application, refer to UM1713 "STM32Cube interfacing with LwIP and applications"

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32F429x/STM32F439x Devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with the following environments:
     - STM324x9I-EVAL board   
     - echotool: (http://bansky.net/echotool/) is used as echo server that sends
       back every incoming data.
      
  - STM324x9I-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect the eval board to remote PC (through a crossover ethernet cable)
      or to your local network (through a straight ethernet cable)
  
  - Remote PC Set-up
    - Configure a static IP address for your remote PC 
      this address must be 192.168.0.11 


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the application
