@par Application Description

This directory contains a set of source files that implement demo based on STemWin 
for STM32F4xx devices.

Note that the following user files may need to be updated:
  LCDConf_stm32f429i_disco_MB1075.c
  GUIConf.c
(if for example more GUI allocated memory is needed)

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.
	  
@note Care must be taken when HAL_RCCEx_PeriphCLKConfig() is used to select the RTC clock source; in this 
      case the Backup domain will be reset in order to modify the RTC Clock source, as consequence RTC  
      registers (including the backup registers) and RCC_BDCR register are set to their reset values.

@par Hardware and Software environment  

  - This application runs on STM32F429xx devices.

  - This application has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F429I-Discovery RevB 
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.
	
  
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
  - Open your preferred toolchain 
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the application
