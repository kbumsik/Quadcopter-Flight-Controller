@par Example Description 

This example show how to play an audio file using the DMA circular mode and 
how to handle the buffer update.

      Plug a headphone to ear the sound  /!\ Take care of yours ears.
      Default volume is 20%.
      The audio file is played in loop
      @Note: Copy file 'audio.bin' (available in AudioFile) directly in the flash 
      at @0x08010000 using ST-Link utility

@note Note the DMA runs in circular buffer mode and never stops. If you break with 
      the debugger, the DMA hw will keep running and a noise will be heard.

@note This example does not use BSP_AUDIO so the MspInit is coded in the main.c.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F446xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32446E-EVAL
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.      

  - STM32446E-EVAL Set-up :
    There are no special switches for this example 

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
