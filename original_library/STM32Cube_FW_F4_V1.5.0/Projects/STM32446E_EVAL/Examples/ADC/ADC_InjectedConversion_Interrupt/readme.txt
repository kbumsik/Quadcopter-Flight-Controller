@par Example Description 

This example describes how to interrupt continuous ADC1 regular ADC_CHANNEL_4 conversion 
using ADC1 injected ADC_CHANNEL_12 and how to get the converted value of this conversion.

The ADC1 is configured to convert continuously regular ADC_CHANNEL_4
and convert injected ADC_CHANNEL_12 (connected to PC.02) when injected conversion starts
(after one second of the start of regular channel).

Each time a regular channel end of conversion occurs an interrupt is generated 
and the converted data of ADC1 DR register is affected to the uhADCxConvertedRegValue 
variable in the ADC conversion complete callback function. After one second of
the start of regular ADC_CHANNEL_4 conversion the injected ADC_CHANNEL_12 conversion starts 
so regular conversion is temporary interrupted until the end of injected conversion. 
When the injected conversion is finished, an interrupt is generated, and the  
converted injected data of ADC1 DR register is affected to the uhADCxConvertedInjValue  
variable in the ADC conversion complete callback function.

Conversion time (reference manual, Reset and Clock control part):
  The function SystemClock_Config() configures the clock divider as follows:
  1) The system clock is 180 MHz.
  2) AHB Prescaler = 1 => AHB clock is 180 MHz.
  2) APB2 Prescaler = 2 => APB2 clock is 90 MHz.
  3) ADC Prescaler = 2 => ADC clock is 45 MHz. (45 Mhz max)

  Sampling time is set to ADC_SAMPLETIME_56CYCLES (56 cycles).
  ConvTime = Sampling time + 12 cycles ADC conversion time + 3 cycles sampling time.
           = 71 clock cycles
           = 4.7 us


User can vary the ADC_CHANNEL_4 voltage using the Eval Board potentiometer (P2) connected to PA.04.
SB94 must be closed to use the potentiometer.

STM32 Eval board's LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer status:
  - LED3 is ON when there are an error in initialization.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F446xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM32446E-EVAL board revB and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32446E-EVAL Set-up
    - Use the Potentiometer (P2) of the Eval board (connected to  PA.04).
    - Connect PC.02 to a power supply (do not forget to connect the power supply 
      GND to the EVAL board GND)
      
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
