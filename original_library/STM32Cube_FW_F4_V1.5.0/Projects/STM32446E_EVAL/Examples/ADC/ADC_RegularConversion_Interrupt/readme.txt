@par Example Description 

This example describes how to use the ADC1 with channel ADC_CHANNEL_4 in interrupt mode to convert data.

The ADC3 is configured to convert continuously ADC_CHANNEL_4.

Each time an end of conversion occurs an interrupt is generated and the converted 
data of ADC3 DR register is affected to the uhADCxConvertedValue variable in the 
ADC conversion complete call back function.

In this example, the system clock is 180MHz, APB2 = 90MHz and ADC clock = APB2/2. 
Since ADC3 clock is  MHz and sampling time is set to 3 cycles, the conversion 
time to 12bit data is 12 cycles so the total conversion time is (12+3)/45= 0.33us(3Msps).

User can vary the ADC_CHANNEL_4 voltage using the Eval Board potentiometer (P2) connected to PA.4.
SB94 must be closed to use the potentiometer.

STM32 Eval board's LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer status:
  - LED3 is ON when there are an error in initialization.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F446xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM32446E-EVAL board revB and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
