@par Example Description 

This example shows how to synchronize TIM1 and Timers (TIM3 and TIM4) in parallel mode.

Timers synchronisation in parallel mode:


                                                       ___________ 
                                                 ITR0 |  SLAVE 1  |
                                     _________________|    TIM3   |
   ___________                      |                 |___________|
  |   MASTER  |TRGO_Update          |                 
  |    TIM1   |---------------------|               
  |___________|                     |                  ___________ 
                                    |_________________|  SLAVE 2  |
                                                 ITR0 |    TIM4   |
                                                      |___________|
                         

1/ TIM1 is configured as Master Timer:
   - PWM Mode is used
   - The TIM1 Update event is used as Trigger Output 
 
2/ TIM3 and TIM4 are slaves for TIM1,
   - PWM Mode is used
   - The ITR0(TIM1) is used as input trigger for both slaves
   - Gated mode is used, so starts and stops of slaves counters
     are controlled by the Master trigger output signal(update event).

The TIM1 counter clock is 180 MHz.

  The Master Timer TIM1 is running at:
  TIM1 frequency = TIM1 counter clock / (TIM1_Period + 1) = 703.125 KHz and
  a the duty cycle equal to: TIM1_CCR1/(TIM1_ARR + 1) = 50%

  The TIM3 is running at: 
  (TIM1 frequency)/ ((TIM3 period +1)* (TIM1_Repetition_Counter+1)) = 46.875 KHz and
  a duty cycle equal to TIM3_CCR1/(TIM3_ARR + 1) = 33.3%

  The TIM4 is running at:
  (TIM1 frequency)/ ((TIM4 period +1)* (Repetition_Counter+1)) = 70.312 KHz and
  a duty cycle equal to TIM4_CCR1/(TIM4_ARR + 1) = 50%


The PWM waveform can be displayed using an oscilloscope.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F446xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32446E-EVAL board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.      

  - STM32446E-EVAL Set-up
   Connect the following pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms:
      - TIM1 CH1 (PA.08 : pin 1 in CN6 connector)
      - TIM3 CH1 (PC.06)
      - TIM4 CH3 (PB.08)

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all
 - Load project image: Project->Download and Debug
 - Run program: Debug->Go(F5)
