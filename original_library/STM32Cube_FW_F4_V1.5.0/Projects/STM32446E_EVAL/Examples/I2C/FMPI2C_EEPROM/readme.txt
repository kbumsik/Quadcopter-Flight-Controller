      STM32446E-EVAL

This example guides you through the different configuration steps by mean of HAL API 
to ensure I2C Data buffer transmission and reception with DMA.
The communication is done with an I2C EEPROM memory.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
clock (SYSCLK) to run at 180 MHz.

The I2C peripheral configuration is ensured by the HAL_I2C_Init() function.
This later is calling the HAL_I2C_MspInit()function which core is implementing
the configuration of the needed I2C resources according to the used hardware (CLOCK, 
GPIO, DMA and NVIC). You may update this function to change I2C configuration.

The I2C/EEPROM communication is then initiated.
The HAL_I2C_Mem_Read_DMA() and the HAL_I2C_Mem_Write_DMA() functions allow respectively 
the reception of Data from EEPROM and the transmission of a predefined data 
buffer.

For this example the TxBuffer is predefined and the aRxBuffer size is same as aTxBuffer.

In a first step the I2C writes the aTxBuffer by group of 4 bytes (RF EEPROM 
Page size) using HAL_I2C_Mem_Write_DMA() then read back the data through aRxBuffer
using HAL_I2C_Mem_Read_DMA(). 
The end of this two steps are monitored through the HAL_I2C_GetState() function
result.
Finally, aRxBuffer and aRxBuffer are compared through Buffercmp() in order to 
check buffers correctness.  

STM32 Eval board's LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer status:
 - LED1 is ON when the transmission process is complete.
 - LED1 switches OFF when the reception process is complete.
 - LED1 blinks when comparison is correct and test successfully ended.
 - LED3 is ON when there is an error in transmission/reception process.  

 @note I2Cx instance used and associated resources can be updated in "main.h"
       file depending hardware configuration used.

 @note This example was tested with an RF EEPROM ANT7-M24LR-A  that has the address 0xA6.
       If a different EEPROM is used to test, EEPROM_ADDRESS in main.c should be
       updated with the right value.
