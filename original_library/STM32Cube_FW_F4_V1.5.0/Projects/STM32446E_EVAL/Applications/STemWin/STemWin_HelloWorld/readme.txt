@par Description

This directory contains a set of source files that implement a simple "Hello
Wolrd" example based on STemWin for STM32F4xx devices.

The example allows also to run the different Segger samples that can be
downloaded from here:
http://www.segger.com/emwin-samples.html
To do this, user has only to replace the file "Basic_HelloWorld.c" into the
project workspace by the downloaded one.
As example, two sample source files are provided (but not linked to the project):
	STemWin/HelloWorld/Src/MEMDEV_WM_Ticker.c
	STemWin/HelloWorld/Src/MOVIE_ShowFeatures.c

Note that the following user files may need to be updated:
  LCDConf_stm32446e_eval.c
  GUIConf_stm32446e_eval.c
(if for example more GUI allocated memory is needed)

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F446xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32446E_EVAL evaluation board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
  - Open your preferred toolchain 
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the example
