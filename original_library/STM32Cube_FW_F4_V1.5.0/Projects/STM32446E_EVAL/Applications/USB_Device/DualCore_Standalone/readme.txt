@par Application Description 

This application is a part of the USB Device Library package using STM32Cube firmware. It describes how to use
USB device application based on the STM32F446xx multi core support feature integrating the Device Communication 
Class (CDC) and Human Interface (HID) in the same project.

This is a typical application on how to use the STM32F446xx USB OTG Device peripheral, where STM32 is 
enumerated as a CDC device in the High Speed mode, and also as a HID device in the Full Speed mode,
using the native PC Host HID/CDC drivers to which the STM32446E-EVAL board is connected.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset all the peripherals,
initialize the Flash interface and the systick. The user is provided with the SystemClock_Config()
function to configure the system clock (SYSCLK) to run at at 180 MHz. The Full Speed (FS) USB module uses
internally a 48-MHz clock which is coming from a specific output of two PLLs PLL or PLL SAI.
In the High Speed (HS) mode the USB clock (60 MHz) is driven by the ULPI.

The 48 MHz clock for the USB FS can be derived from one of the two following sources:
  – PLL clock (clocked by the HSE): If the USB uses the PLL as clock source, the PLL VCO clock must be programmed
    to output 336 MHz frequency (USBCLK = PLLVCO/PLLQ).
  – PLLSAI clock (clocked by the HSE): If the USB uses the PLLSAI as clock source, the PLLSAI VCO clock must be programmed
    to output 384 MHz frequency (USBCLK = PLLSAIVCO/PLLSAIP).

When the application is started, the user has just to plug the two USB cables into a PC host and two
USB devices (CDC/HID) are automatically detected. A new VCP drive appears in the system window
for the CDC device and serial communication operations can be performed as with any other serial
communication drive. A new HID Mouse device is detected, and the Joystick buttons mounted on 
the STM32446E-EVAL board, allow to user to emulate the Mouse directions.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

"STM32Cube USB Device library".
      

@par USB Library Configuration

To select the appropriate USB Core to work with, user must add the following macro defines within the
compiler preprocessor (already done in the preconfigured projects provided with this application):
      - "USE_USB_HS" and "USE_USB_FS" when using USB Dual Core Mode

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32F446xx devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32446E-EVAL 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32446E-EVAL RevB Set-up
    - Connect the STM32446E-EVAL board to the PC through two 'USB micro A-Male 
      to A-Male' cables to the connectors:
      - CN8: to use USB High Speed (HS)
      - CN9: to use USB Full Speed (FS)
    - Connect the STM32446E-EVAL board to the PC (or to another evaluation board) through RS232 (USART)
      serial cable CN25 (USART1) connector.
	  @note Make sure that:
         - jumper JP4 is on USART1_RX position (1-2) 
	       - jumper JP6 is on USART1_TX position (2-3) 
	       - jumper JP7 is on USART1_TX position (1-2) 
	       - jumper JP8 is on USART1_RX position (1-2)
  
    - For loopback mode test: remove RS232 cable on CN16 and connect directly USART TX and RX pins:
      PA10 and PA9 (with a cable or a jumper)
