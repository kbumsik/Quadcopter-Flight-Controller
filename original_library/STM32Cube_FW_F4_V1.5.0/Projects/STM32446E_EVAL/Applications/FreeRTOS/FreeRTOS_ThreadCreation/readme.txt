@par Description

This directory contains a set of sources files that implement a thread creation 
example using CMSIS RTOS API 

This example creates two threads with the same priority, which executes in 
a periodic cycle of 15 seconds. 

In the first 5 seconds, the thread 1 toggles LED1 each 200 ms and the 
thread 2 toggles LED3 each 500 ms
In the second 5 seconds, the thread 1 suspend itself and the thread 2
continue toggling LED3
In the last 5 seconds, the thread 2 resume execution of thread 1 then 
suspend itself, the thread 1 toggles the LED1 each 400 ms    


@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

For more details about FreeRTOS implementation on STM32Cube, please refer to UM1722 "Developing Applications 
on STM32Cube with RTOS".

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F446xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM32446E-EVAL board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
    
    
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
