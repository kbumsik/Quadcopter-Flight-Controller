### V1.2.3/25-December-2014 ###
===============================
  The purpose of this release is to remove compilation errors and warning. It also reintroduces
  the function osThreadIsSuspended() which has been removed in the version V1.2.0.

  + cmsis_os.c
      - osThreadGetPriority() and makeCmsisPriority(): replace INCLUDE_vTaskPriorityGet by the correct
         freeRTOS constant uxTaskPriorityGet.
         The version 1.2.2 is using a wrong constant INCLUDE_vTaskPriorityGet, while the correct freeRTOS
         constant is uxTaskPriorityGet.
         This fix ensure a safe use of osThreadGetPriority() function.

      - osThreadIsSuspended(): this function has been removed in version V1.2.0, it is now available gain.
         User can either use this function to check if a Thread is suspended either use function osThreadGetState,
         which is more generic, to check the exact state of a thread.
                                               
      - osThreadList(): this function is now taking as argument a pointer to uint8_t instead of a pointer to int8_t.
         The change is made to remove a compilation warning.

      - osRecursiveMutexCreate(): the prototype has been changed to osMutexId osRecursiveMutexCreate (const osMutexDef_t *mutex_def)
          This change is made to make osRecursiveMutexCreate() compatible with function MutexCreate().
          It also allow the better use of the function in conjunction with the macro osMutex, note that osMutex return a
          "const osMutexDef_t *mutex_def".
          example : osMutex1Id = osRecursiveMutexCreate (osMutex(Mutex1));

      - Fix implementation of functions osSemaphoreWait(), osMutexRelease() and osMutexWait() by using the appropriate
         freeRTOS “FromISR” APIs when called from an interrupt.

      - Fix compilation warning when the constant INCLUDE_eTaskGetState is not defined

  + cmsis_os.h
      - osThreadIsSuspended(): add function prototype.
      - osThreadList(): function prototype modified as described in cmsis_os.c section.
      - osRecursiveMutexCreate(): function modified as described in cmsis_os.c section.

  + Important note:
    Mail Queue Management Functions are not supported in this cmsis_os version, will be added in the next release.


### V1.2.2/04-December-2014 ###
===============================
  + cmsis_os.c, osSemaphoreCreate(): use vSemaphoreCreateBinary() instead of xSemaphoreCreateBinary(),
    to keep compatibility with application code developed on FreeRTOS V7.6.0.


### V1.2.1/07-November-2014 ###
===============================
  + cmsis_os.h: modify the osThreadState enum to fix warning generated by ARMCC compiler
  + task.c: add preprocessor compilation condition for prvTaskIsTaskSuspended() function 
            (it's build only when INCLUDE_vTaskSuspend option is enabled in FreeRTOSConfig.h file)


### V1.2.0/04-November-2014 ###
===============================
  + Upgrade to use FreeRTOS V8.1.2 and CMSIS-RTOS V1.02.
  + cmsis_os.c
      - Almost of CMSIS-RTOS APIs are implemented for FreeRTOS
      - Additional wrapper APIs created for FreeRTOS

  + Important note:
    When upgrading existing application code to use this last version, the following 
    update should be considered:
      - osThreadIsSuspended() is no longer public API in FreeRTOS and it should
        be replaced by the wrapping of eTaskGetState()
      - osKernelStart() API changed, must be updated
      - update FreeRTOSConfig.h file, taking FreeRTOSConfig_template.h file as reference


### V1.1.2/13-June-2014 ###
===========================
  + FreeRTOSConfig_template.h: add this definition #define INCLUDE_xTaskGetSchedulerState 1
                               to enable the use of xTaskGetSchedulerState() API in the 
                               application code. 


### V1.1.1/30-April-2014 ###
============================
  + cmsis_os.c: add preprocessor compilation condition when calling some FreeRTOS APIs, to avoid link
                errors with MDK-ARM when some FreeRTOS features are not enabled in FreeRTOSConfig.h


### V1.1.0/22-April-2014 ###
============================
  + Add Tickles mode for CM0 port (IAR, GCC, RVDS).


### V1.0.0/18-February-2014 ###
===============================
   + FreeRTOS V7.6.0 customized version for STM32Cube solution.
