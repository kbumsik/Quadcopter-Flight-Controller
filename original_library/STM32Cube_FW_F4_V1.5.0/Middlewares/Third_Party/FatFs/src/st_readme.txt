### V1.2.1/20-November-2014 ###
============================
  + Disk I/O drivers; change count argument type from BYTE to UINT

  + Important note:
      For application code based on previous FatFs version; when moving to R0.10b
      the only change that need to be done is to update ffconf.h file, taking 
      ffconf_template.h file as reference.


### V1.2.0/04-November-2014 ###
============================
  + Upgrade to use FatFs R0.10b.
  + diskio.c: update disk_read() and disk_write() argument's type.

  + Important note:
      For application code based on previous FatFs version; when moving to R0.10b
      the only change that need to be done is to update ffconf.h file, taking 
      ffconf_template.h file as reference.


### V1.1.1/12-September-2014 ###
============================
  + ff_gen_drv.c: Update the Disk_drvTypeDef disk variable initialization to avoid
    warnings detected with Atollic TrueSTUDIO Complier.


### V1.1.0/22-April-2014 ###
============================
  + Update sd_diskio to use SD BSP in polling mode instead of DMA mode (the scratch
    buffer needed for DMA alignment is removed as well).
  + diskio.c and ff_gen_drv.c/.h: update to prevent multiple initialization.


### V1.0.0/18-February-2014 ###
===============================
   + First R0.10 customized version for STM32Cube solution.
